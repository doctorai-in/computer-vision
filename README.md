* [head_detection](https://github.com/doctorai-in/head_detection.git) created by AJ
  - The model has been trained using the Hollywood Heads dataset as positive samples, and a subsample of the EgoHands dataset as negative samples. This model has       been developed using Pierluigi Ferarri's Keras implementation of SSD as primary source (of which we provide some essential code), and replicates the original       Matconvnet version of our model.

   - intel Example
   - This sample application detects objects in a video stream and calculates the average count of the object in the video stream.

 * [intractive_face_detection : openvino Models Using Opencv](https://github.com/doctorai-in/intractive_face_detection.git)
   - In particular, this demo uses 5 models to build a pipeline able to detect faces on videos, their keypoints (aka "landmarks"), and recognize persons using the      provided faces database (the gallery). 
 * [keras_training_and_transfer_learning](https://github.com/doctorai-in/keras_training_and_transfer_learning.git)
   - This model is trained using Adience dataset The model is tested to work with Illustra Pro 2MP Micro Camera.
